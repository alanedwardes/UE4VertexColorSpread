## What is this
I once wrote a [forum post](https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?14851-Painting-Vertex-Colours-From-Code) about painting vertex colours from code, and since then people have been bugging me to release the final source code for my little experiment.

I suspect it is useful to show how to use the Unreal Engine 4 APIs rather than being anything special itself, however do what you want with the code. And please submit pull requests back if you fix something, I will actively review, test and accept changes :)
